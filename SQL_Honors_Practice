Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Use joins to query data from multiple tables

Create and query views

Write and run stored procedures

Use transactions

Scenario
In this project, you will work with three datasets that are available on the City of Chicago's Data Portal:

Socioeconomic indicators in Chicago
Chicago public schools
Chicago crime data
You must download each dataset, create a table for each one, and load the appropiate dataset through the Db2 console. If you have already completed the Hands on Lab: Joins, you can reuse the tables you created for that hands-on lab. However, you should not reuse similar tables with other names from other exercises or labs, as they may not create the correct results.

Important note:

If you have not yet downloaded the three datasets from the City of Chicago's Data Portal, created the required tables, and loaded the data, please follow the instructions in this section.

City of Chicago Datasets
Socioeconomic indicators in Chicago
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012. A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2

Chicago public schools
This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t

Chicago crime data
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

Store the datasets in database tables
The lab requires you to have these three tables populated with a subset of the whole datasets. Download the 'ChicagoCensusData.csv', 'ChicagoPublicSchools.csv', and 'ChicagoCrimeData.csv' datasets below and load the data into your Db2 On Cloud database.

Chicago Census Data

Chicago Public Schools

Chicago Crime Data

You need to create a new table for each dataset. As you load each dataset, click on "(+) New Table", specify the name of the table you want to create, and then click "Next".


Name the new tables as follows:

CENSUS_DATA
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
After you have created the tables, review the data in each table by using the View Data feature in the Db2 On Cloud console.

Exercise 1: Using Joins
You have been asked to produce some reports about the communities and crimes in the Chicago area. You will need to use SQL join queries to access the data stored across multiple tables.

Question 1
Write and execute a SQL query to list the school names, community names and average attendance for communities with a hardship index of 98.
Hint 1
Hint 2
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query and its results.

Question 2
Write and execute a SQL query to list all crimes that took place at a school. Include case number, crime type and community name.
Hint 1
Hint 2
Hint 3
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query and its results.

Exercise 2: Creating a View
For privacy reasons, you have been asked to create a view that enables users to select just the school name and the icon fields from the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table. By providing a view, you can ensure that users cannot see the actual scores given to a school, just the icon associated with their score. You should define new names for the view columns to obscure the use of scores and icons in the original table.

Question 1
Write and execute a SQL statement to create a view showing the columns listed in the following table, with new column names as shown in the second column.
Column name in CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS	Column name in view
NAME_OF_SCHOOL	School_Name
Safety_Icon	Safety_Rating
Family_Involvement_Icon	Family_Rating
Environment_Icon	Environment_Rating
Instruction_Icon	Instruction_Rating
Leaders_Icon	Leaders_Rating
Teachers_Icon	Teachers_Rating
Write and execute a SQL statement that returns all of the columns from the view.

Write and execute a SQL statement that returns just the school name and leaders rating from the view.

Take a screenshot showing the last SQL query and its results.

Exercise 3: Creating a Stored Procedure
The icon fields are calculated based on the value in the corresponding score field. You need to make sure that when a score field is updated, the icon field is updated too. To do this, you will write a stored procedure that receives the school id and a leaders score as input parameters, calculates the icon setting and updates the fields appropriately.

Question 1
Write the structure of a query to create or replace a stored procedure called UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE that takes a in_School_ID parameter as an integer and a in_Leader_Score parameter as an integer. Don't forget to use the #SET TERMINATOR statement to use the @ for the CREATE statement terminator.
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query.

Question 2
Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL statement to update the Leaders_Score field in the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID to the value in the in_Leader_Score parameter.
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query.

Question 3
Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL IF statement to update the Leaders_Icon field in the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID using the following information.
Score lower limit	Score upper limit	Icon
80	99	Very strong
60	79	Strong
40	59	Average
20	39	Weak
0	19	Very weak
Hint 1
Hint 2
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query.

Question 4
Run your code to create the stored procedure.
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query and its results.

Write a query to call the stored procedure, passing a valid school ID and a leader score of 50, to check that the procedure works as expected.
Exercise 4: Using Transactions
You realise that if someone calls your code with a score outside of the allowed range (0-99), then the score will be updated with the invalid data and the icon will remain at its previous value. There are various ways to avoid this problem, one of which is using a transaction.

Question 1
Update your stored procedure definition. Add a generic ELSE clause to the IF statement that rolls back the current work if the score did not fit any of the preceding categories.
Hint 1
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query.

Question 2
Update your stored procedure definition again. Add a statement to commit the current unit of work at the end of the procedure.
Hint 1
Take a screenshot showing the SQL query.

Run your code to replace the stored procedure.

Write and run one query to check that the updated stored procedure works as expected when you use a valid score of 38.

Write and run another query to check that the updated stored procedure works as expected when you use an invalid score of 101.
